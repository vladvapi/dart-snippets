# sets


## Exercices

1. **Create and Print a Set**
* Create a Set of integers: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
* Print the Set.

2. **Add and Remove Elements**
* Create an empty Set of strings.
* Add the words "apple", "banana", and "cherry".
* Remove "banana".
* Print the updated Set.

3. **Filter Elements**
* Create a Set of integers: {10, 15, 20, 25, 30}.
* Use the where() method to filter and print numbers greater than 20.

4. **Transform Elements**
* Create a Set of integers: {1, 2, 3, 4}.
* Use the map() method to create a new Set where each element is squared, and print it.

5. **Find Intersection**
* Create two Sets: {1, 2, 3, 4} and {3, 4, 5, 6}.
* Find and print the intersection of these Sets.

6. **Find Union**
* Create two Sets: {1, 2, 3} and {4, 5, 6}.
* Find and print the union of these Sets.

7. **Find Difference**
* Create two Sets: {1, 2, 3, 4} and {3, 4, 5, 6}.
* Find and print the difference between the first and the second Set.

8. **Check Subset**
* Create two Sets: {1, 2, 3} and {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
* Check if the first Set is a subset of the second, and print the result.

9. **Remove Duplicates**
* Create a List of integers: [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5].
* Convert it to a Set to remove duplicates, and print the resulting Set.

10. **Check for Element**
* Create a Set of strings: {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}.
* Check if "banana" is in the Set and print the result.

11. **Find First Match**
* Create a Set of integers: {5, 10, 15, 20, 25}.
* Use the firstWhere() method to find and print the first number greater than 12.

12. **Retain Specific Elements**
* Create a Set of integers: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.
* Use the retainWhere() method to retain only even numbers, and print the updated Set.

13. **Find Unique Strings**
* Create a List of strings: ["apple", "banana", "apple", "cherry", "banana"].
* Convert it to a Set to find unique strings and print them.

14. **Iterate Through a Set**
* Create a Set of integers: {100, 200, 300}.
* Use a for loop to print each element.

15. **Combine Sets**
* Create two Sets: {1, 3, 5} and {2, 3, 6}.
* Combine the Sets using union() and print the result.

16. **Convert Set to List**
* Create a Set of strings: {"red", "blue", "green"}.
* Convert it to a List and print the result.

17. **Sum Elements**
* Create a Set of integers: {5, 10, 15}.
* Use the reduce() method to calculate and print the sum of all elements.

18. **Find Maximum Value**
* Create a Set of integers: {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}.
* Use the reduce() method to find and print the maximum value.

19. **Difference Between Two Sets**
* Create two Sets: {1, 2, 3, 4} and {3, 4, 5, 6}.
* Print elements that are only in the first Set but not in the second.

20. **Check If Any Element Meets Condition**
* Create a Set of integers: {2, 4, 6, 7, 8}.
* Use the any() method to check if any element is odd, and print the result.
