8. **Filter a List**
* Create a list of numbers: [2, 7, 10, 15, 18, 21].
* Use the where method to filter numbers greater than 10 and print the resulting list.

9. **Convert a List**
* Create a list of integers: [1, 2, 3, 4].

11. **Filter Even Numbers**
* Create a list of integers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
* Use the where() method to filter and print only even numbers.

12. **Filter Strings by Length**

15. **Sum All Elements with reduce()**
* Create a list of integers: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50].
* Use the reduce() method to calculate and print the sum of all elements.

16. **Custom Sorting**
* Create a list of strings: ["grape", "apple", "banana", "kiwi", "cherry"].
* Use the sort() method with a custom comparator to sort the list in descending order of string length.

17. **Check All Elements**
* Create a list of integers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10].
* Use the every() method to check if all elements are even, and print the result.

18. **Check Any Element**
* Create a list of integers: [3, 5, 7, 9, 12].
* Use the any() method to check if any element is divisible by 2, and print the result.

19. **Combine Two Lists**
* Create two lists: [1, 2, 3] and [4, 5, 6].
